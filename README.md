# Unity3D Video Player

To learn more about this project, check out the video where I build it out. https://youtu.be/ffJoBfj41GU

This project provides a simple of example of how to manipulate video playback using Unity's VideoPlayer. This was built using Unity3D 5.6. The code should work just fine in later versions unless a major API update was made in the version you are using. Again, we are just scratching the surface here.
